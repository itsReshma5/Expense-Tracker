## Project Overview  
The system is designed with the following steps:  
1. Problem Understanding: Identified the need for managing and analyzing expenses.  
2. Database Design:  
   - ER Model and Relational Schemas were created to structure the database.  
   - Database tables were designed and normalized to remove redundancy.  
3. SQL Queries Implemented:  
   - Constraints  
   - Joins  
   - Views  
   - Triggers  
   - Cursors  
4. Concurrency Control & Recovery Mechanism:  
   Ensured secure and reliable database transactions.  
5. Front-End Development:  
   Developed a simple interface using HTML, CSS, and PHP on the XAMPP platform.
